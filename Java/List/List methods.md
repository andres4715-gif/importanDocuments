# **Methods of the List Interface**

Since the main concept behind the different types of the lists is the same, the list interface contains the following methods:

## _add(int index, element):_

This method is used to add an element at a particular index in the list. When a single parameter is passed, it simply adds the element at the end of the list.

```text
addAll(int index, Collection collection):
This method is used to add all the elements in the given collection to the list. When a single parameter is passed, it adds all the elements of the given collection at the end of the list.
```

```text
size():
This method is used to return the size of the list.
```
